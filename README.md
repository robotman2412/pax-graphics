# MCH2022?
[MCH2022](https://mch2022.org/) was a hackercamp in the summer of 2022.
MCH is the successor of SHA2017, where [Badge.Team](https://badge.team/) made their first badge.

The badge is an electronic event badge which can do much more than just show your name.
To accomplish all the cool graphics people can draw, this graphics stack was made.
